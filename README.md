# SniProxy
SniProxy based on dnsmasq and nginx

## How to Run ?!
- Install docker and docker-compose
- Run with `` docker-compose up -d ``
- Change docker-compose.yml based on your preferences !
- I try to update the `` dnsmasq/proxy.conf `` file based on the internet status of Iran
- It could be resource intensive task to serve this dns service to many people so bring a powerhouse
- I tested on a 2gigs 2 cpus vps and It is OK for me and my family and friends
